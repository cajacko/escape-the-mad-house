## Problem

_What's the problem?_

The dissatisfaction of most players losing in improv based party games.

The limitations of building stories on your own in improv based party games.

The unaccessibility of traditional improv games with a more mainstream audience (it can be intimidating, or considered acting)

### Existing Alternatives

_How else are people solving this problem right now?_

- Bucket of Doom
  - Not co-operative
- Fun Employed
  - Not co-operative
- Playing traditional improv games
  - Often requires people who are much more improv inclined

## Solution

_How are you solving the problems? Add a link to the latest place to find the current solution_

A co-operative improv based party game for 2+ players. Where you all play 1 character as different split personalities. Each player narrates their way through different challenges having been secretly given a specific way to tell the story. All other players try to figure out what kind of story they were trying to tell. This determines how successful they were navigating through the challenges

### High Level Concept

_Describe the solution in a few words that anyone could understand_

## Uncertainties

_What are you most uncertain about? Prioritise this list and add potential tests to help us become more certain_

- **Is Derek the best name for the main character?** _(Try out different names in the narrative rules, and see how people react)_
- **Would a competitive version of the rules be a good inclusion?**
- **What are the best reaction cards to have**
- **What are the best personality cards to have**
- **How do you make all the players feel like they're working together**
- **How does it feel if the character dies early? Would it ruin the game**
- **What's the best number of reaction/personality cards**
- **How do you make the players all believe they are Derek and in the mad house?**
