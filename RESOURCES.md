| Main Text    | Flavour Text  |
| ------------ | ------------- |
| Unlikely     | Hmmmm         |
| Funny        | Lolz          |
| Horrifying   | Aaaargh       |
| Lame         | Boo           |

| Brutal       | Daaaam        |
| Confusing    | Errr... What? |

### Personality Cards

For the current play tests, we have just been picking 2 random **Reaction Cards** from the
**Active Players** hand, 1 is the **Success Reaction** the other is the **Critical Fail Reaction**.

This is going to change, as we found it's important to specifically pair the **Success Reaction**
and **Critical Fail Reaction** to be quite similar, to increase the stakes and likelihood of a
**Critical Fail**.
