# Development Notes

- Think up some new names for the main character.
- Definitely seems possible to come up with a competitive set of rules as a bonus
- Need to really work on the Reaction Cards. Think up more, experiment with more specific reactions.
  And try with the flavour text being more prominent than the title currently is.
- Add fun flavour text for when the character dies. Definitely on each Exit Card, but also have a
  generic one in the rules.
