# Development Notes

- Think up some new names for the main character.
- Definitely seems possible to come up with a competitive set of rules as a bonus
- Need to really work on the Reaction Cards. Think up more, experiment with more specific reactions.
  And try with the flavour text being more prominent than the title currently is.
- Add fun flavour text for when the character dies. Definitely on each Exit Card, but also have a
  generic one in the rules.
- Need something closer to Erotic? Romantic?
- Reduce the number of reaction cards. Holding and going through 13 is a bit too much. Maybe 7-10?
  But don't want to limit stories too much.
- Players kept forgetting they were Derek and in the room. Started narrating as if a different
  background situation happened.
- could have a little board representing a room, where you place the room card, items and derek?
  Although makes it a bit harder to handle
