[Table of Contents](#contents)

## Rules

### Setup

Hello Derek, you're just another person, living the life of a person.

> Place the **Derek Card** in the middle of the table, place 6 **Health Tokens** on the card

You're a fancy man Derek, you're house has lots of rooms.

> Shuffle the **Room Cards** and place them face down in the center of the table. This is the **Room Deck**

You've just arrived home from a long day at your job as an accountant. You open your front door and step in. Oh no, the door behind you closes and youâ€™ve entered the mad house!

On encountering the shear madness of the mad house, you're split personalities start triggering.

> Shuffle the **Personality Cards** and place face down in the middle of the table. Also distribute one of each **Reaction Card** to each player

Derek, you better find your way out of this mad house. It looks dangerous and full of strange things.

> Randomly pick an **Exit Card** and place it on the bottom of the **Room Deck**. You're objective is to progress through every **Room Card** in the **Room Deck** until you get to and resolve the **Exit Card**. Pick a the person who did the craziest thing today to be the first **Active Player**.

### Round

#### Situation

Right let's see what's in this room.

> The **Active Player** draws the top room card and places it face up on the table. The read out the situation on the card.

The trauma of such a room has triggered one of your split personalities to come out.

> The **Active Player** draws a **Personality Card**, and keeps the contents of the card secret from all other players. This card will specify a **Success Reaction** that the **Active Player** wants the **Non Active Players** to guess based off their **Narration**. It will also have **Critical Fail Reaction** that they want to make sure the **Non Active Players** don't guess.

Oh no this room sounds terrible! Luckily, Derek, as you look around you notice some items that might help you escape this room.

> The **Active Player** draws 3 **Item Cards** and places them face up on the table. They annouce the title of each card as they do.

#### Narration

Oh Derek, you have got yourself into a bit of a pickle. Let's see what you decide to do.

> The **Active Player** must now narrate to the rest of the players how they resolve the situation presented by the **Room Card**. They must use at least 1 of the **Item Cards** in front of them. Their goal is to get the **Non Active Players** to pick the matching **Success Reaction** present on the **Active Players** **Personality Card**, whilst making sure they won't pick the **Critical Fail Reaction**.

#### Result

Wow, Derek, wow. What a fascinating way of trying to exit the room. Let's see how you did.

> Each **Non Active Player** thinks about what **Success Reaction** the **Active Player** may have had on their **Personality Card**, based off the **Narration** they just told. They pick one of their **Reaction Cards** and places it face down in front of them. When every **Non Active Player** is ready, they all reveal their chosen **Reaction Card**. If one card has a majority, that is the **Final Reaction Card**, if there is a tie the **Next Active Player** gets to decide which one is the **Final Reaction Card**.
>
> If the **Final Reaction Card** matches the **Success Reaction** the **Result** is a **Success**
>
> If the **Final Reaction Card** matches the **Critical Fail Reaction** the **Result** is a **Critical Fail**
>
> In all other situations the **Result** is a **Fail**
